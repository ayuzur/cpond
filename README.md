## make

_note I used gcc_

1. git clone
2. ensure you have ncurses installed. (ncurses6 was used)
3. move into your local clone of the repo
4. run `make` to get the cpond executable

## usage
- to run `./cpond`

- `-b or --braille` allows you to toggle the use of braille characters
    - This makes it so you don't have to zoom out (as far) to see the fish!
- `-c or --count` allows you to set the number of fish
- `--fps` allows you to change the fps by changing the delay between frames.
    - ex: `--fps 60` will set the delay between frames to 1s / 60.

while runnning

- type q to quit
- type p to toggle pause
